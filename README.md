# ToDoList
About this project ToDo List Web

This project is here to help anyone to organise and manage his/her task easily. you can add a task, delete task, and even set priority levels (High, Medium, Low).


I wanted This app to be both useful and visually, so it comes with a dark mode as it was requested, smooth hover efects, and continuous animated header, everything is saved in a brawser, so the task stick around even if you clode the page.

This project helped me practice semantic HTML5, Tailwind css, and JavaScript basics like functions, conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation.

# What you can do with it
- create/add a new task
- delete the task
- Update the task
- set the priority levels

#Tech I used
- HTML5
- Tailwind css
-  External css for extra styling
- JavaScritp

# How to use it
- Type the task
- Choose the priority level
- Click Add task
- Your task will appear in the list with a date and time and the color depends on which level it is in.
- Click delete to remove a task

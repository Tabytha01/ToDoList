# ToDoList
About This Project

Hey there! This is my To Do List Application, built to help anyone stay organized and manage daily tasks easily. You can quickly add tasks, see when you added them, mark them complete/incomplete, delete tasks, and even set priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

I wanted this app to be both useful and visually appealing, so it comes with a dark mode, smooth hover effects, and a continuous animated header. Everything you do is saved in your browser, so your tasks stick around even if you close the page.

This project helped me practice semantic HTML5, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript basics like functions, conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation.

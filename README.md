About this project ToDo List Web

This project is here to help anyone to organise and manage his/her task easily. you can add a task, delete task, and even set priority levels (High, Medium, Low).


I wanted This app to be both useful and visually, so it comes with a dark mode as it was requested, smooth hover efects, and continuous animated header, everything is saved in a brawser, so the task stick around even if you clode the page.

This project helped me practice semantic HTML5, Tailwind css, and JavaScript basics like functions, conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation.

What you can do with it
1. create/add a new task
2. delete the task
3. set the priority levels

Tech I used
1.HTML5
2.Tailwind css
3. External css for extra styling
4. JavaScritp

How to use it
1.Type the task
2.Choose the priority level
3.Click Add task
4.Your task will appear in the list with a date and time and the color depends on which level it is in.
5.Click delete to remove a task

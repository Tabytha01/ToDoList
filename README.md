About this project ToDo List Web

This project is here to help anyone to organise and manage his/her task easily. you can add a task, delete task, and even set priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
I wanted this App 

About This app to be both useful and visually, so it comes with a dark mode as it was requested, smooth hover efects, and continuous animated header , everything is saved in a brawser, so the task stick around even if you clode the page.

What you can do with it
1. create/add a new task
2. delete the task

Tech I used
1.HTML5
2.Tailwind css
3. External css for extra styling
